Initial authors: Samantha Hsu, Jason Han, Terry Lin and Almas Khan
This is the UBC local hack day project done on Nov.30/19.

Further improved on by Samantha Hsu.

### Description:

Users input drug names and if they negatively interact based on the [Drug Interaction Database](https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/InteractionAPIs.html#), a graph is created displaying these interactions.
